# Allows you to set the logging level, current options are
# 50 - CRITICAL
# 40 - ERROR
# 30 - WARNING
# 20 - INFO
# 10 - DEBUG
# 0 - NOTSET
# NOTE: whatever you set it to it will include any higher numbered levels, so 40 logs error and critical and is a good default
# while 10 will help a good bit with debugging, I dont recommend leaving it on 10 indefinitely without a good logrotate setup else you'll just
# waste disk space.
logLevel: 40

# client list is where I plan on putting the data to replace the expanding if/elif chonk, ideally you wont need the Board defined per cx (i know thats what im pitching to management here)
# The first client listed here will be the default value used if no other matches are found, as such I dont recommend changing the prefix from default.
